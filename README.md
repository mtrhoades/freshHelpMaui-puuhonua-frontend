Fresh Help Maui Non-Profit

This website is going to be for the Pu'uhonua O Nene homeless camp in Kahului, Maui, Hawaii.

Fresh Help Maui provides 3 meals a day (breakfast, lunch, & dinner) to this homeless camp as part of a program through the state of Hawaii.

The Front-end will show daily menus for the residents of the homeless camp so they know what meals they will be getting daily.

It will also provide an option for leaving feedback on each meal of the day.
